@tableau()partition
A (Young) tableau is encoded in LiE by a vector v, such that v[i] records
the row number of the entry i in the Young tableau. The numbers v[i] should
be positive, and in any initial part of v no number may occur more often than
a lower number. The 2-dimensional form can be retrieved by the function call
print_tab(v).
Example		v=[1,2,1,1,2,1,3]; print_tab(v)

		1 3 4 6
		2 5
		7
